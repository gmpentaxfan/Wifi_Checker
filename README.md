# Wifi_Checker
Verify Wifi Connections

Designed for a corporate environment where the wireless is pushed out via group policy.

We have issued with laptops not connecting to wireless after they have been asleep or hibernated.

Look at the WirelessChecker branch for the solution.
It is only a taskbar icon with...

- right click accessed menu bar
- Alt-Click to manually run diagnostics
- Ctrl-Click to close the program

Program.cs is setup to only allow one instance at a time.
See https://github.com/gmpentaxfan/Wifi_Checker/blob/master/Wifi%20Checker%20Upload.png for some screenshots of the program in use.
